# Memorize Scripture

I want to use the gift of software development that God has given me to build up the body of Christ:

> From Him the whole body [the church, in all its various parts], 
> joined and knitted firmly together _by what every joint supplies_, 
> _when each part is working properly_, 
> causes the body to grow and mature, 
> building itself up in [unselfish] love.

# Running the application

Run the following command inside a Linux Bash shell:

`$ bash ./docker/up.sh`

# Build the application

Run the following command inside a Bash shell:

`$ bash ./docker/build.sh`

Now, the application will be inside the `dist` directory.
